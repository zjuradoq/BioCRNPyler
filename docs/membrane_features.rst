Introduction
-------------

BioCRNpyler supports modeling genetic circuits with membrane-associated 
features using computational tools. This functionality enables users to 
construct and simulate genetic circuits that incorporate membrane components 
and mechanisms within simplified cell-free system models. 
 
BioCRNpyler's membrane-associated features allow for the representation of 
inducer dynamics, including diffusion across membranes or transport via 
channels and transporters. These membrane-associated features facilitate 
facilitate the design and refinement of models that connect mechanistic biology 
with computational analysis, bridging the gap between conceptual design and 
experimental implementation in synthetic biology. :ref:`Figure 3.1 <fig-current_membrane_models>` 
provides an overview of the membrane proteins currently included in BioCRNpyler.

Membrane Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following membrane-associated components are available in BioCRNpyler:

- ``DiffusibleMolecule()``: Represents a molecule that can diffuse freely across
  or within compartments, such as ions, gases, or small polar molecules. 

- ``IntegralMembraneProtein()``: Represents a protein embedded permanently within
  the membrane, spanning the lipid bilayer. 

- ``MembraneChannel()``: A subtype of integral membrane protein that represents
  a membrane protein that uses passive or facilitated transport to move 
  specific ions or molecules across the membrane via a pore.

- ``MembranePump()``: A subtype of integral membrane protein that represents 
  an active transport protein that moves ions or molecules against their 
  concentration gradient using energy (e.g., ATP).

- ``MembraneSensor()``: A subtype of integral membrane protein that represents 
  a protein embedded in the membrane that detects environmental or intracellular
  signals (e.g., ligand binding, voltage change) and initiates a cellular 
  response, such as activating a signaling cascade.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Membrane Mechanisms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following membrane-associated mechanisms that are available in BioCRNpyler:

- ``Simple_Diffusion()``: 
  Models the passive movement of small, nonpolar molecules across the membrane, 
  driven by concentration gradients, without the need for membrane proteins or 
  energy input.

- Membrane protein-mediated mechanisms:
    - ``Membrane_Protein_Integration()``: 
      Models the insertion and proper orientation of proteins into the 
      membrane, ensuring their structural and functional integration within the
      lipid bilayer.

    - ``Simple_Transport()``: Models the passive movement of substrates through 
      membrane pores/channels along concentration gradients without requiring 
      energy input.

    - ``Facilitated_Transport()``: Models the passive movement of substrates 
      along concentration gradients by binding to carrier proteins that undergo 
      conformational changes without requiring energy input.
  
    - ``Primary_Active_Transport()``: Models the active movement of substrates
      against concentration gradients by binding to membrane pumps, which undergo
      conformational changes driven by energy input (e.g., ATP).

    - ``Membrane_Signaling_Pathway_MM()``: Models the environmental sensing 
      through a signaling pathway involving a sensor kinase and phosphorylation 
      of a response regulator protein, enabling adaptive cellular responses.

:ref:`Figure 3.2 <fig-flow_chart_membrane_features>` illustrates the various options 
available for modeling transport and two-component signaling within BioCRNpyler. It 
specifically highlights the membrane components (orange boxes), their corresponding 
mechanisms (green boxes), and species (blue boxes).


----------------
Diffusible Molecule
----------------
~~~~~~~~~~
Component: ``DiffusibleMolecule()``
~~~~~~~~~~

A Diffusible Molecule refers to a class of molecules that can pass through cell 
membranes without assistance. Examples of such molecules include gases like 
oxygen (O\ :sub:`2`\) and carbon dioxide (CO\ :sub:`2`\), as well as small polar
but uncharged molecules. In contrast, larger uncharged molecules and charged 
molecules require membrane proteins for transport across the membrane.

The following code defines a diffusible molecule called `S`:

.. code-block:: python

    # Define component
    S = DiffusibleMolecule('name')

Unless otherwise specified, the species `S` will reside in the `internal` 
compartment. The membrane component ``DiffusibleMolecule(Component)`` will then 
create a species `product`, which is a copy of `S` but located in the 
`external` compartment.

.. _simple-diffusion:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mechanism: ``Simple_Diffusion()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simple diffusion allows molecules to cross membranes passively down their 
concentration gradient. Simple diffusion is the most basic mechanism by 
which molecules can traverse a membrane, commonly referred to as passive 
diffusion. In this process, a molecule can dissolve in the lipid bilayer, 
diffuse across it, and reach the other side. This mechanism does not require 
the assistance of membrane proteins, and the transport direction is determined 
by the concentration gradient, moving from areas of high concentration to areas 
of low concentration.

In BioCRNpyler, the ``DiffusibleMolecule()`` component uses the mechanism 
``Simple_Diffusion()``, which is defined as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    # Mechanism
    mech_tra = Simple_Diffusion()
    transport_mechanisms = {mech_tra.mechanism_type: mech_tra}


~~~~~~~~~~
Example 1: Diffusion of nitrate
~~~~~~~~~~
Construct a chemical reaction network (CRN) for the diffusion of nitrate 
(NO\ :sub:`3`\) across a membrane.

.. figure:: figures/Simple_Diffusion.png
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

   **Figure 3.3**: *Simple diffusion across a lipid bilayer.*

Consider the following diffusion step for the diffusion of nitrate (NO\ :sub:`3`\).

.. math::

    (NO_3)_{internal} \rightleftharpoons (NO_3)_{internal}

To model the example above using the ``Diffusible_Molecule()`` component and the 
``Simple_Diffusion()`` mechanism, we must first define the diffusible molecule 
and then incorporate it into a mixture using the mechanism to construct a CRN.

.. code-block:: python

    # Define diffusible molecules
    NO3 = DiffusibleMolecule('NO3')

    # Mechanisms
    mech_tra = Simple_Diffusion()
    transport_mechanisms = {mech_tra.mechanism_type: mech_tra}

    # Create mixture
    M0 = Mixture("Diffusible_Molecule", components=[NO3],
                 parameter_file="membrane_toolbox_parameters.txt",
                 mechanisms=transport_mechanisms)

    # Compile the CRN with Mixture.compile_crn
    CRN = M0.compile_crn()

    # Print the CRN to see what you created
    print(CRN.pretty_print())

**Console Output:**

.. code-block:: text

    Species(N = 2) = {NO3 (@ 0),  NO3 (@ 0),}

    Reactions (1) = [
    0. NO3 <--> NO3
     Kf=k_forward * NO3_Internal
     Kr=k_reverse * NO3_External
      k_forward=0.0002
      found_key=(mech=simple_diffusion, partid=None, name=k_diff).
      search_key=(mech=simple_diffusion, partid=NO3, name=k_diff).
      k_reverse=0.0002
      found_key=(mech=simple_diffusion, partid=None, name=k_diff).
      search_key=(mech=simple_diffusion, partid=NO3, name=k_diff).

-------------
Integral Membrane Protein
-------------

~~~~~~~~~~
Component: ``IntegralMembraneProtein()``
~~~~~~~~~~

Integral Membrane Proteins refer to a class of proteins embedded within the lipid 
bilayer of cellular membranes. These proteins typically span the membrane and 
play essential roles in transport, signaling, and structural support. Once 
integrated, they can mediate the movement of other molecules or relay signals 
across the membrane.

The following code defines an integral membrane protein component called `IMP`. 
It requires two inputs: ``membrane_protein`` and ``product``, which can be 
either strings or ``Species`` objects.

.. code-block:: python
    
    # Define component
    IMP = IntegralMembraneProtein(membrane_protein = "MP", product = "P")

Optional arguments may be provided to designate the direction of transport, define 
the stoichiometry, and specify the compartment.

.. code-block:: python

    IMP = IntegralMembraneProtein(
        membrane_protein = "MP",
        product = "P",
        direction = None,
        size = None,
        compartment = "Internal",
        membrane_compartment = "Membrane",
        cell = None,
        attributes = None
    )

**Key Optional Parameters**

- ``direction``: Specifies the transport direction with `Exporter`,
  `Importer`, or `Passive` (default) options. The default value of 
  `Passive` indicates that the membrane protein is an integral
  membrane protein. This default may apply to non-transporter proteins or 
  unidirectional transporters.  The flux of the substrates, based on the 
  ``direction``, follows the general transport below.
    - Exporter: :math:`S_{in} \rightarrow S_{out}`  
    - Importer: :math:`S_{in} \leftarrow S_{out}`  
    - Passive: :math:`S_{in} \leftrightarrow S_{out}`

- ``size``: Defines the number of monomers required for the integral membrane 
  used in ``Membrane_Protein_Integration()`` and the subsequent reactions. For 
  homo-oligomer membrane proteins, we can include an input for `size` as 
  either a numerical string or an integer.
    - If provided: :math:`MP_{monomer} * size \rightarrow MP_{oligomer} \rightarrow IMP`
    
    - If not: :math:`MP \rightarrow IMP`

.. _membrane—protein-integration:

~~~~~~~~~~
Mechanism: ``Membrane_Protein_Integration()``
~~~~~~~~~~

Membrane protein integration refers to the process by which proteins inserted are
proteins are correctly localized and oriented within the membrane, a crucial 
step for their function in transport, signaling, or structural roles. The 
mechanism does not model active transport or signaling directly, but it provides
the foundational step of embedding proteins into the membrane, where they can 
carry out these roles.

The ``IntegralMembraneProtein()`` component uses the ``Membrane_Protein_Integration()`` 
mechanism. The mechanism for integrating membranes can be implemented and 
stored in a dictionary.

.. code-block:: python

    # Mechanism
    mech_integration = Membrane_Protein_Integration()
    integration_mechanisms = {mech_integration.mechanism_type: mech_integration}


~~~~~~~~~~
Example 2: Integration of alpha-hemolysin
~~~~~~~~~~
Construct a chemical reaction network (CRN) for the membrane integration steps 
of alpha-hemolysin.

.. figure:: figures/Membrane_Integration.png
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

   **Figure 3.4**: *Integration of membrane proteins into the lipid bilayer.* 

Consider the following membrane integration steps for alpha-hemolysin.

1. **Assemble into a homoheptamer:**

.. math::

    7\alpha HL_{monomer} \rightarrow \alpha HL_{homoheptamer}

2. **Integration of membrane protein in the membrane:**

.. math::

    \alpha HL_{homoheptamer} \rightarrow \alpha HL_{channel}

To model the example above using the ``IntegralMembraneProtein()`` component and 
the ``Membrane_Protein_Integration()`` mechanism, we must first define the 
integral membrane protein (e.g., alpha-hemolysin) and then incorporate it into 
a mixture using the integration mechanism to construct a CRN. 

.. code-block:: python

    # Define membrane protein
    alphaHL = IntegralMembraneProtein('alphaHL_monomer', product='alphaHL', size = 7)
    
    # Mechanisms
    mech_integration = Membrane_Protein_Integration()
    integration_mechanisms = {mech_integration.mechanism_type: mech_integration}

    # Create mixture
        M = Mixture("alphaHL", components = [alphaHL_monomer],
                    parameter_file = "membrane_toolbox_parameters.txt",
                    mechanisms = integration_mechanisms)

    #Compile the CRN and print
        CRN = M.compile_crn()
        print(CRN.pretty_print())

**Console Output:**

.. code-block:: text

    Species(N = 3) = {
    complex[7x_protein[alphaHL_monomer]] (@ 0),  protein[alphaHL_monomer] (@ 0),  protein[alphaHL(Passive)] (@ 0),

-------------
Membrane Channels 
-------------

~~~~~~~~~~
Component: ``MembraneChannel()``
~~~~~~~~~~

Membrane channels refer to a class of proteins, a subclass of integral membrane 
proteins, that are pore-forming and create gated pathways across the lipid 
bilayer. They allow specific molecules or ions to pass through the membrane 
and play key roles in regulated transport, enabling the movement of substrates 
in response to concentration gradients or signaling events.

The following code defines a membrane channel component called `MC`. It 
requires two inputs: ``integral_membrane_protein`` and ``substrate``, which 
can be either strings or ``Species`` objects.

.. code-block:: python

    # Define component
    MC = MembraneChannel(integral_membrane_protein = "IMP", substrate = "S")

The component also accepts optional inputs, similar to the ``IntegralMembraneProtein()``. 
However, if the `integral membrane protein` has already been defined using 
``IntegralMembraneProtein()``, the ``MembraneChannel()`` will inherit its ``direction`` 
and `compartment` properties from the existing species (e.g., `IMP`).

The ``MembraneChannel()`` component can utilize the ``Simple_Transport()`` or 
``Facilitated_Transport_MM()`` mechanism. The choice of mechanism depends on 
the biological behavior of the channel. You can choose from one of the 
following options:

- **Simple_Transport**:  
    Allows bidirectional movement of substrates following the concentration 
    gradient. The direction of the membrane channel must be set to `Passive`.
- **Facilitated_Transport_MM**:  
    Allows the unidirectional movement of substrates, also along concentration 
    gradient. The ``direction`` of the membrane channel must be either `Importer` 
    or `Exporter`.

.. _simple-transport:

~~~~~~~~~~
Mechanism: ``Simple_Transport()``
~~~~~~~~~~

Simple transport models the passive movement of substrates across the membrane 
through protein channels or pores. This mechanism enables molecules to move 
down their concentration gradient without energy input. It assumes the channel
is always open or allows diffusion based on molecular properties without 
involving binding or conformational changes.

The ``Simple_Transport()`` mechanism involves a one-step reaction following the 
resulting reaction is a reversible diffusion-like process:

.. math::

    S_{internal} + MC \leftrightarrow S_{external} + MC

The mechanism for simple transport can be implemented and stored in a dictionary.

.. code-block:: python

    # Mechanism
    mech_transport = Simple_Transport()
    transport_mechanisms = {mech_transport.mechanism_type: mech_transport}


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Example 3: Simple Transport by alpha-hemolysin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Construct a chemical reaction network (CRN) for the transport of ATP through 
alpha-hemolysin.

.. figure:: figures/Simple_Transport.png
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

   **Figure 3.5**: *Passive transport through membrane pores or channels.*

Consider the following reaction of the transport of ATP through the alpha-hemolysin 
pore:

.. math::

    ATP_{internal} + \alpha HL_{channel} \leftrightarrow ATP_{external} + \alpha HL_{channel}

To model the example above using the ``Membrane_Channel()`` component and the 
``Simple_Transport()`` mechanism, we use the previously defined integral 
membrane protein (e.g., alphaHL) represented by `alphaHL_monomer.product` 
and incorporate it into a mixture with the transport mechanism to construct
a CRN that enables passive transport across the membrane.

.. code-block:: python

    # Define membrane channel
    alphaHL_channel = MembraneChannel(alphaHL_monomer.product, substrate ="ATP")    
    
    # Mechanisms
    mech_transport = Simple_Transport()
    transport_mechanisms = {mech_transport.mechanism_type:mech_transport}

    # Create mixture
        M = Mixture("aHL_transport", components = [alphaHL_channel],
                parameter_file = "membrane_toolbox_parameters.txt",
                mechanisms = transport_mechanisms)

    #Compile the CRN and print
        CRN = M.compile_crn()
        print(CRN.pretty_print())

**Console Output:**

.. code-block:: text

    Species(N = 3) = {
    protein[alphaHL(Passive)] (@ 0),  ATP (@ 0),  ATP (@ 0),  
    }

    Reactions (1) = [
    0. ATP+protein[alphaHL(Passive)] <--> ATP+protein[alphaHL(Passive)]
    Kf=k_forward * ATP_Internal * protein_alphaHL_Passive
    Kr=k_reverse * ATP_External * protein_alphaHL_Passive
    k_forward=0.1
    k_reverse=0.1

    ]


.. _facilitated-transport:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mechanism: ``Facilitated_Transport_MM()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Facilitated transport refers to the movement of substrates across a membrane 
with the assistance of specific carrier proteins. These proteins bind to the 
substrate and undergo conformational changes, allowing the molecule to move
from one side of the membrane to the other. Although no energy is required, 
the process is selective and directional, following the concentration gradient 
of the substrate.

The ``Facilitated_Transport_MM()`` mechanism involves binding, translocation, 
and unbinding steps. For example, if the membrane channel is an `importer`, 
the resulting reactions are:

1. **Binding and transport of substrate (S) across the membrane:**

.. math::

    S_{external} + MC \rightarrow S_{external}:MC_{channel} \rightarrow S_{internal}:MC 

2. **Unbinding substrate from transporter:**

.. math::

    S_{internal}:MC_{channel} \rightarrow S_{internal} + MC_{channel}

To use ``Facilitated_Transport_MM()``, we need to redefine the membrane channel 
to include a transport direction designation, such as `Importer` or 
`Exporter`. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    # Define component
    MC = MembraneChannel(integral_membrane_protein = "IMP", substrate = "S",     
                         direction = 'Importer')

Then, the mechanism for facilitated transport can be implemented and stored in 
a dictionary.

.. code-block:: python

    # Mechanism 
    mech_transport = Facilitated_Transport()
    transport_mechanisms = {mech_transport.mechanism_type: mech_transport}


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Example 4: Facilitated transport of glucose by GLUT1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Construct a chemical reaction network (CRN) for the transport of glucose through 
the membrane channel glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1).

.. figure:: figures/Facilitated_Transport.png
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

   **Figure 3.6**: *Facilitated diffusion via carrier proteins.*

Consider the following reactions of the transport of glucose by GLUT1.

1. **Integration of membrane protein in the membrane:**

.. math::

    GLUT1_{monomer} \rightarrow GLUT1_{channel}

2. **Binding and transport of glucose across the membrane:**

.. math::

    glucose_{external} + GLUT1_{channel} \rightarrow glucose_{external}:GLUT1_{channel} \rightarrow glucose_{internal}:GLUT1_{channel}

3. **Unbinding glucose from transporter:**

.. math::

    glucose_{internal}:GLUT1_{channel} \rightarrow glucose_{internal} + GLUT1_{channel}


To model the example above using the ``MembraneChannel()`` component and the 
``Facilitated_Transport_MM()`` mechanism, we can either redefine the 
``Membrane_Channel()`` component or the integral membrane protein GLUT1
using the ``IntegralMembraneProtein()`` component to incorporate directionality.

The following example begins by defining the integral membrane protein, 
including the specification of its transport direction.

.. code-block:: python

    # Define integral membrane protein
    glut1 = IntegralMembraneProtein('glut1', product='glut1_channel',
                                    direction='Importer', size= 1)

    # Define membrane channel
    glut1_channel = MembraneChannel(glut1.product, substrate='glucose')

    # Mechanisms
    mech_integration = Membrane_Protein_Integration()
    mech_transport = Facilitated_Transport_MM()

    all_mechanisms = {mech_integration.mechanism_type:mech_integration,
                    mech_transport.mechanism_type:mech_transport}

    # Create mixture
        M = Mixture(components=[glut1, glut1_channel],
            mechanisms=all_mechanisms,
            parameter_file = "membrane_toolbox_parameters.txt") 

    #Compile the CRN and print
        CRN = M.compile_crn()
        print(CRN.pretty_print(show_keys=False))

**Console Output:**

Membrane Pumps 
-------------

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Component: ``MembranePump()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Membrane pumps are a class of transport proteins, also considered a subclass of 
integral membrane proteins, that actively move molecules or ions across the 
lipid bilayer. Unlike passive channels, pumps use energy, typically from ATP 
or an electrochemical gradient, to drive the transport of substrates against 
their concentration gradients.

The following code defines a membrane pump component called `MC`. It requires
two inputs: ``integral_membrane_protein`` and ``substrate``, which can be 
either strings or ``Species`` objects.

.. code-block:: python

    # Define component
    MP = MembranePump(membrane_pump = "MP", substrate = "S")

The component also accepts optional inputs, similar to the ``IntegralMembraneProtein()``.
If the integral membrane protein was previously defined using the component
``IntegralMembraneProtein()``, then the ``MembranePump()`` will inherit its ``direction`` and
`compartment` properties from the existing species (e.g., `IMP`). 

Additionally, optional arguments can be provided to control the transport direction, 
stoichiometry, and compartment.

.. code-block:: python

    MP = MembranePump(membrane_pump = "MP", substrate = "S",
                    direction = None,
                    internal_compartment ='Internal',
                    external_compartment ='External',
                    ATP = None, cell = None, attributes=None)

**Key Optional Parameters**

- ``ATP``: Specifies the necessary amount of ATP needed for transport to take place. 
  In the absence of a specified integer value for ``ATP``, the model defaults to a 
  value of 1.

- ``direction``: By default, the ``direction`` is set to ``None``, generating a 
  CRN corresponding to an exporter.

The ``MembranePump()`` component uses the ``Primary_Active_Transport_MM()`` mechanism.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mechanism: ``Primary_Active_Transport_MM()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Primary active transport refers to the energy-dependent movement of substrates 
across the membrane, typically against their concentration gradient. This process 
involves specialized membrane pumps that attach to the substrate and undergo 
conformational changes driven by the hydrolysis of ATP. The transport mechanism is 
both selective and directional. 

The ``Primary_Active_Transport_MM()`` mechanism captures this behavior through 
binding, energy-driven conformational changes, and unbinding steps. For example, 
if the membrane pump is classified as an **exporter**, the resulting reactions are: 

1. **Binding of antibiotic substrate (S) to membrane pump (MP):**

.. math::

    S_{internal} + MP_{exporter} \rightleftharpoons S_{internal}:MP_{exporter}

2. **Binding of ATP to the complex of S with MP:**

.. math::

    ATP_{internal} + S_{internal}:MP_{exporter} \rightleftharpoons ATP_{internal}:S_{internal}:MP_{exporter}

3. **Export of S from the internal compartment to the external compartment:**

.. math::

    ATP_{internal}:S_{internal}:MP_{exporter} \rightarrow ATP_{internal}:S_{external}:MP_{exporter}

4. **Unbinding of S:**

.. math::

    ATP_{internal}:S_{external}:MP_{exporter} \rightarrow ADP_{internal}:MP_{exporter} + S_{external}

5. **Unbinding of ADP from MP:**

.. math::

    ADP_{internal}:MP_{exporter} \rightarrow ADP_{internal} + MP_{exporter} 

To use ``Primary_Active_Transport_MM()``, we need to redefine the membrane channel 
to include a transport direction designation, such as `Importer` or `Exporter`. 
For example:

.. code-block:: python

    # Define component
    MC = MembraneChannel(integral_membrane_protein = "IMP", substrate = "S",     
                         direction = 'Importer')

Then, the mechanism for facilitated transport can be implemented and stored in a dictionary.

.. code-block:: python

    # Mechanism
    mech_transport = Primary_Active_Transport_MM()
    transport_mechanisms = {mech_transport.mechanism_type: mech_transport}

Example 5: Export of erythromycin by MsbA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Construct a chemical reaction network (CRN) for the export of the antibiotic 
erythromycin driven by the membrane pump MsbA.

   **Figure 3.7**: *Primary active transport using membrane pumps.*

Consider the following reactions for the export of erythromycin by MsbA.

1. **Integration of membrane protein in the membrane:**

.. math::

    MsbA_{homodimer} \rightarrow MsbA_{exporter}

2. **Binding of antibiotic (Abx) substrate (e.g., erythromycin) to MsbA transporter:**

.. math::

    Abx_{internal} + MsbA_{exporter} \leftrightarrow Abx_{internal}:MsbA_{exporter}

3. **Binding of ATP to a complex of erythromycin with MsbA:**

.. math::

    2ATP_{internal} + Abx_{internal}:MsbA_{exporter} \leftrightarrow 2ATP_{internal}:Abx_{internal}:MsbA_{exporter}

4. **Export of erythromycin lipid from inner membrane to outer membrane:**

.. math::

    2ATP_{internal}:Abx_{internal}:MsbA_{exporter} \rightarrow 2ATP_{internal}:Abx_{external}:MsbA_{exporter}

5. **Unbinding of erythromycin:**

.. math::

    2ATP_{internal}:Abx_{external}:MsbA_{exporter} \rightarrow 2ADP_{internal}:MsbA_{exporter} + Abx_{external}

6. **Unbinding of ADP from MsbA:**

.. math::

    2ADP_{internal}:MsbA_{exporter} \rightarrow 2ADP_{internal} + MsbA_{exporter}

To model the example above using the ``MembranePump()`` component and the 
``Primary_Active_Transport_MM()`` mechanism, we can either define the pump directly 
or specify the integral membrane protein (e.g., MsbA) using the ``IntegralMembraneProtein()`` 
component to incorporate transport directionality.

The following example begins by defining the integral membrane protein, including 
the specification of its direction (e.g., `Exporter`).

.. code-block:: python

    # Define integral membrane protein
    MsbA = IntegralMembraneProtein('MsbA', product='MsbA_pump',
                                    direction='Exporter', size= 2)

    # Define membrane pump
    MsbA_pump = MembranePump(MsbA.product, substrate = 'abx', ATP = 2)

    # Mechanisms
    mech_integration = Membrane_Protein_Integration()
    mech_transport = Membrane_Protein_Integration()

    all_mechanisms = {mech_integration.mechanism_type:mech_integration,
                    mech_transport.mechanism_type:mech_transport}

    # Create mixture
        M = Mixture(components = [MsbA, MsbA_pump,],
        mechanisms = all_mechanisms,
        parameter_file = "membrane_toolbox_parameters.txt") 

    #Compile the CRN and print
        CRN = M.compile_crn()
        print(CRN.pretty_print(show_keys = False))

Membrane Sensors 
---------------

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Component: ``MembraneSensor()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Membrane sensors are a type of membrane protein classified as a subgroup of integral 
membrane proteins. These proteins are designed to detect external signals or 
environmental changes at the cell surface.  Typically, these sensors are part of 
larger signaling systems, such as two-component systems. They initiate signal 
transduction pathways by responding to specific stimuli, including chemical ligands, 
changes in osmotic pressure, or shifts in pH. When activated, membrane sensors often 
undergo conformational changes or autophosphorylation, which triggers downstream 
responses within the cell.

~~~~~~~~~~
Component: ``MembraneSensor()``
~~~~~~~~~~

The following code defines a membrane sensor component called ``Membrane_sensor()``. 
This component requires **four inputs**:

- ``membrane_sensor_protein``: the membrane-bound sensor protein (e.g., a histidine kinase)
- ``response_protein``: the cytoplasmic response regulator
- ``assigned_substrate``: the substrate to which the sensor is assigned or responds
- ``signal_substrate``: the substrate that acts as the external signal or inducer

.. code-block:: python

    # Define component
    Membrane_sensor = MembraneSensor(
        membrane_sensor_protein = "IMP",    
        response_protein = "RP",
        assigned_substrate = "S_assigned",
        signal_substrate = "S_signal"
    )

**Key Optional Parameters**

- ``ATP``: an integer representing the number of ATP molecules required for phosphorylation events.  
  The default value is **2** if not explicitly specified.

The ``MembraneSensor()`` component utilizes the ``Membrane_Signaling_Pathway_MM()`` mechanism to model 
two-component signaling systems, where signal detection at the membrane results in phosphorylation-driven 
regulatory responses within the cell.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mechanism: ``Membrane_Signaling_Pathway_MM()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Membrane Signaling Pathway models the two-component signaling process, allowing
cells to detect and respond to external environmental signals using a membrane-bound 
sensor kinase and a cytoplasmic response regulator. This mechanism facilitates 
signal transduction without the need for direct substrate transport across the 
membrane. When the sensor kinase detects a stimulus, it undergoes autophosphorylation, 
transferring a phosphate group to the response regulator. This transfer initiates 
downstream cellular responses.

The ``Membrane_Signaling_Pathway_MM()`` mechanism captures two-component signaling behavior using 
Michaelis-Menten kinetics to model key steps such as stimulus detection, sensor autophosphorylation, 
and phosphate transfer to a response regulator. The following reactions illustrate the signaling pathway 
modeled by the ``Membrane_Signaling_Pathway_MM()`` mechanism. These steps follow Michaelis-Menten dynamics 
to represent enzymatic interactions such as substrate binding, phosphorylation, and dephosphorylation.

1. **Signal detection and binding of the signal substrate (S_sig) to the membrane sensor (M_sensor):**

.. math::

    M_{\text{sensor}} + S_{\text{sig}} \rightleftharpoons M_{\text{sensor}}{:}S_{\text{sig}} \equiv M^{*}_{\text{sensor}}

2. **Auto-phosphorylation of the membrane sensor via ATP binding:**

.. math::

    M^{*}_{\text{sensor}} + 2\,ATP_{\text{internal}} \rightleftharpoons M^{*}_{\text{sensor}}{:}2\,ATP_{\text{internal}} 
    \rightarrow M^{*2P}_{\text{sensor}}{:}2\,ADP_{\text{internal}} 
    \rightarrow M^{*2P}_{\text{sensor}} + 2\,ADP_{\text{internal}}

3. **Phosphorylation of the response protein (RP):**

.. math::

    M^{*2P}_{\text{sensor}} + RP \rightleftharpoons M^{*2P}_{\text{sensor}}{:}RP 
    \rightarrow M^{*}_{\text{sensor}}{:}RP^{*} 
    \rightarrow M^{*}_{\text{sensor}} + RP^{*}

4. **Dephosphorylation of the phosphorylated response protein (RP*):**

.. math::

    RP^{*} \rightarrow RP + P_{i}

Then, the mechanism for membrane signaling can be implemented and stored in a dictionary.

.. code-block:: python

    # Mechanism
	mech_sensor = Membrane_Signaling_Pathway_MM()
	sensor_mechanisms = {mech_sensor.mechanism_type:mech_sensor}

3. **Detection and binding of nitrate**

.. math::

    \rightarrow NarX^{*2P}_{\text{sensor}}{:}2\,ADP_{\text{internal}} 
    \rightarrow NarX^{*2P}_{\text{sensor}} + 2\,ADP_{\text{internal}}

5. **Phosphorylation of the response regulator NarL:**

.. math::

    NarX^{*2P}_{\text{sensor}} + NarL \rightleftharpoons NarX^{*2P}_{\text{sensor}}{:}NarL 
    \rightarrow NarX^{*}_{\text{sensor}}{:}NarL^{*} 
    \rightarrow NarX^{*}_{\text{sensor}} + NarL^{*}

6. **Dephosphorylation of phosphorylated NarL (NarL\*):**

.. math::

    NarL^{*} \rightarrow NarL + P_{i}


To model the example above using the ``MembraneSensor()`` component and the 
``Membrane_Signaling_Pathway_MM()`` mechanism, we can begin by defining a new integral 
membrane protein (e.g., NarX) using the ``IntegralMembraneProtein()`` component. This 
protein will serve as the membrane-bound sensor in the signaling pathway.

The following example begins by defining the integral membrane protein, followed by 
the membrane sensor. Both components are combined to form a mixture, which includes 
the response regulator and relevant signaling substrates.

.. code-block:: python

    # Define integral membrane protein
    NarX = IntegralMembraneProtein('NarX', product='NarX_sensor',
                                size = 2)

    # Define membrane sensor
    NarX_sensor = MembraneSensor(NarX.product, response_protein = 'NarL',
                            assigned_substrate = 'P', signal_substrate = 'NO3', ATP = 2)

    # Mechanisms
    mech_integration = Membrane_Protein_Integration()
    mech_sensing = Membrane_Signaling_Pathway_MM()

    all_mechanisms = {mech_integration.mechanism_type:mech_integration,
                    mech_sensing.mechanism_type:mech_sensing}

    # Create mixture
     M = Mixture(components = [NarX, NarX_sensor],
                mechanisms = all_mechanisms,
                parameter_file = "membrane_toolbox_parameters.txt") 

    #Compile the CRN and print
    CRN = E.compile_crn()
    print(CRN.pretty_print(show_keys = False))
